This is my Second Case Study (Project) to work on as a Data Analyst during Incubator Hub Program


# $${\color{blue}INTRODUCTION}$$



In light of recent public scrutiny surrounding gender inequality at The Palmoria Group, a prominent manufacturing company based in Nigeria, the organization has found itself at a critical crossroads. A damning media headline, “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy,” has not only cast a shadow over the company’s internal culture but also threatens its broader business ambitions, particularly its expansion into new regions and international markets.

The CEO, Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma, has expressed deep concern about the implications of this negative press and the potential uncovering of systemic issues such as gender pay disparities and unequal growth opportunities. Determined to take swift and meaningful action, he has tasked the Chief Human Resources Officer, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, with spearheading a comprehensive review of the company’s HR practices through a gender equity lens.

In response, Mr. Shofoluwe has engaged the expertise of an HR Analytics professional to lead a strategic project aimed at uncovering and addressing gender-based disparities within the workforce. This initiative will involve an in-depth analysis of HR data across Palmoria’s three regional operations, with the goal of identifying areas of concern, highlighting patterns of inequality, and providing actionable, data-driven recommendations to foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

This project represents a pivotal step in restoring public trust, safeguarding the company’s reputation, and building a future where gender equality is not just a goal but a foundational principle of Palmoria’s organizational culture.
