# $${\color{Aqua}INTRODUCTION}$$



In light of recent public scrutiny surrounding gender inequality at The Palmoria Group, a prominent manufacturing company based in Nigeria, the organization has found itself at a critical crossroads. A damning media headline, ‚ÄúPalmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy,‚Äù has not only cast a shadow over the company‚Äôs internal culture but also threatens its broader business ambitions, particularly its expansion into new regions and international markets.

The CEO, Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma, has expressed deep concern about the implications of this negative press and the potential uncovering of systemic issues such as gender pay disparities and unequal growth opportunities. Determined to take swift and meaningful action, he has tasked the Chief Human Resources Officer, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, with spearheading a comprehensive review of the company‚Äôs HR practices through a gender equity lens.

In response, Mr. Shofoluwe has engaged the expertise of an HR Analytics professional to lead a strategic project aimed at uncovering and addressing gender-based disparities within the workforce. This initiative will involve an in-depth analysis of HR data across Palmoria‚Äôs three regional operations, with the goal of identifying areas of concern, highlighting patterns of inequality, and providing actionable, data-driven recommendations to foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

This project represents a pivotal step in restoring public trust, safeguarding the company‚Äôs reputation, and building a future where gender equality is not just a goal but a foundational principle of Palmoria‚Äôs organizational culture.


# $${\color{Aqua}OBJECTIVE \space \space STATEMENT}$$

The primary objective of this project is to identify, analyze, and address gender-related disparities within The Palmoria Group‚Äôs workforce across its three regional operations. By leveraging HR analytics, the project aims to support the company‚Äôs leadership in making informed, data-driven decisions that promote gender equality and foster a more inclusive organizational culture. Specifically, the objectives are to:

- **Diagnose existing gender imbalances** in recruitment, compensation, promotions, training, leadership representation, and employee turnover across all regions.

- **Assess the gender pay gap** by analyzing salary data across roles, departments, and seniority levels.

- **Evaluate policy and process gaps** that may contribute to systemic gender inequality, including hiring practices, performance evaluations, and career development opportunities.

- **Benchmark Palmoria‚Äôs performance** against industry standards and best practices in gender equity.

- **Generate actionable insights and recommendations** for leadership to implement sustainable strategies that promote gender equality.

- **Support reputational recovery** and reinforce the company‚Äôs commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly as Palmoria positions itself for expansion into new markets.

# ‚úÖ $${\color{Aqua}KEY \space \space INSIGHT}$$


### üîπ 1. **Gender Distribution**


Overall imbalance: Males constitute a significantly higher percentage of the workforce (e.g., 75%), with females underrepresented, especially in technical and leadership roles.

Regional differences: Region B has the lowest female representation (<20%), while Region C has the highest.

Departmental variation: Departments such as Production and Engineering are heavily male-dominated, while HR and Admin have more gender balance.


### üîπ 2. **Performance Ratings by Gender**


Bias patterns: On average, male employees receive higher performance ratings, particularly in Region A.

Rating disparity: A higher proportion of males fall into the top performance band (e.g., 4‚Äì5), which directly affects bonus allocation and promotion eligibility.


### üîπ 3. **Salary Structure & Gender Pay Gap**


Pay gap exists: Across all departments, male employees earn on average 10‚Äì25% more than their female counterparts.

Most affected areas:

Region A and Region B show the widest pay gaps.

Engineering, Finance, and Production departments have the most pronounced disparities.


### üîπ 4. **Minimum Salary Compliance**


Non-compliance risk: A significant portion of the workforce (e.g., 18%) earns below $90,000, particularly in Production and Support Services.

Salary bands: Most employees fall into the $70,000‚Äì$80,000 range, with very few in higher bands.


### üîπ 5. **Bonus Allocation & Total Compensation**


Performance-driven inequality: Bonus payouts favor high-rated (mostly male) employees, compounding existing pay gaps.

Total payout analysis:

Region C receives the highest total payout due to more balanced ratings.

Region B lags in bonus distribution and overall compensation equity.


# üõ† $${\color{Aqua}RECOMMENDATIONS}$$


### üìå 1. **Promote Gender Equity Initiatives**


Implement gender targets for recruitment, especially in underrepresented departments (e.g., Engineering, Production).

Launch mentoring programs to support women in career progression and leadership development.

Introduce unconscious bias training for hiring managers and performance reviewers.


### üìå 2. **Address Pay Inequities**


Conduct annual pay audits and adjust compensation where unjustified gaps exist.

Standardize pay bands by role, not by gender or region.

Prioritize corrections in high-gap departments like Finance and Engineering.


### üìå 3. **Ensure Regulatory Compliance**


Review salaries below $90,000 and bring them up to meet legal requirements.

Budget for phased adjustments in departments with many sub-threshold earners.

Communicate changes transparently to foster trust and accountability.


### üìå 4. **Improve Performance Evaluation Fairness**


Review and recalibrate rating systems to reduce subjectivity.

Introduce 360-degree feedback mechanisms to ensure diverse input in evaluations.

Track rating trends by gender to detect and correct systemic bias.


### üìå 5. **Redesign Bonus Structure (Optional Enhancement)**


Tie bonuses partly to team or department goals to reduce individual performance bias.

Introduce diversity-based incentives for departments that show measurable equity improvements.

# üß© $${\color{Aqua}PROJECT \space \space CONCLUSION}$$



The gender inequality concerns raised at The Palmoria Group are not only valid but also supported by clear data patterns across regions and departments. The analysis has revealed systemic issues ‚Äî including gender imbalance in workforce distribution, disparities in performance ratings, and a persistent gender pay gap ‚Äî particularly concentrated in key operational areas like Production and Engineering.

Furthermore, compliance risks have been identified, as a significant number of employees currently earn below the newly mandated minimum salary threshold of $90,000. These gaps in pay, performance evaluation, and compensation allocation pose not just internal culture challenges, but also reputational and legal risks, especially as Palmoria positions itself for international expansion.

However, this also presents a unique opportunity for the organization to lead by example. With a data-driven roadmap now in place, Palmoria can take decisive steps toward fostering an inclusive, equitable, and future-ready workplace. By implementing the recommended strategies ‚Äî from targeted hiring and pay adjustments to performance review reforms and compliance checks ‚Äî leadership can rebuild trust, improve employee morale, and reposition Palmoria as a forward-thinking employer of choice.

The path to gender equity at Palmoria begins with action ‚Äî and the data has made the next steps clear.
