# $${\color{blue}INTRODUCTION}$$



In light of recent public scrutiny surrounding gender inequality at The Palmoria Group, a prominent manufacturing company based in Nigeria, the organization has found itself at a critical crossroads. A damning media headline, “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy,” has not only cast a shadow over the company’s internal culture but also threatens its broader business ambitions, particularly its expansion into new regions and international markets.

The CEO, Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma, has expressed deep concern about the implications of this negative press and the potential uncovering of systemic issues such as gender pay disparities and unequal growth opportunities. Determined to take swift and meaningful action, he has tasked the Chief Human Resources Officer, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, with spearheading a comprehensive review of the company’s HR practices through a gender equity lens.

In response, Mr. Shofoluwe has engaged the expertise of an HR Analytics professional to lead a strategic project aimed at uncovering and addressing gender-based disparities within the workforce. This initiative will involve an in-depth analysis of HR data across Palmoria’s three regional operations, with the goal of identifying areas of concern, highlighting patterns of inequality, and providing actionable, data-driven recommendations to foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

This project represents a pivotal step in restoring public trust, safeguarding the company’s reputation, and building a future where gender equality is not just a goal but a foundational principle of Palmoria’s organizational culture.

The primary objective of this project is to identify, analyze, and address gender-related disparities within The Palmoria Group’s workforce across its three regional operations. By leveraging HR analytics, the project aims to support the company’s leadership in making informed, data-driven decisions that promote gender equality and foster a more inclusive organizational culture. Specifically, the objectives are to:

- **Diagnose existing gender imbalances** in recruitment, compensation, promotions, training, leadership representation, and employee turnover across all regions.

- **Assess the gender pay gap** by analyzing salary data across roles, departments, and seniority levels.

- **Evaluate policy and process gaps** that may contribute to systemic gender inequality, including hiring practices, performance evaluations, and career development opportunities.

- **Benchmark Palmoria’s performance** against industry standards and best practices in gender equity.

- **Generate actionable insights and recommendations** for leadership to implement sustainable strategies that promote gender equality.

- **Support reputational recovery** and reinforce the company’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly as Palmoria positions itself for expansion into new markets.
